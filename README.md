## Availability : 

**How much time do you plan to spend on your GSOC?**

 I intend to spend about **36 Hours** per week *( 6 Hours every day * 6 Days )*  during the **3 Month Period**.  On weekends if required, I can spend more than 6 hours.  Mostly i work during the evening hours from  **6:00pm to 11:00pm** but during **holidays** i can work early in the morning also from **3:30 am to 6:00 am** .

**What are your intended start and end dates?**

I can start working on the project after **10th-15th May 2020** as after **15th May** my exams will be over and my 3 month  summer vacation will start by that time, so I will be able to fully concentrate on the project. Also I will require about 1 week's time ( During Community Bonding period or after ) to get to the drawing board with my mentor and design the higher level API from scratch in order to build API of high quality with ample amount of flexibility in it.  I intend to finish the project work on or before **August 10 2020**.

**What other factors affect your availability ?**

During the month of **July** I would request  **2 days** leave as i would have to go for an exhibition along with my team in Bangalore for **MC Afee Scholars Programme**. Other than that I am completely free during the summers and don't have any other commitments as such.

 During my first and second semester I had scored around 870 and 836 respectively and did not secure any Rank from the university or college.
	 
**Internship/Jobs/Courses Audited**

 - I organized and mentored **Advanced C++ Programming Course** in my college for 6 weeks during my first year with students from 2nd, 4th and 6th semester
 - I audited Introduction to C++ course from National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning ( NPTEL ) and was in the 5% toppers category
 - Last summer I also audited a course in Ethical Hacking from Internshala

**Programming Interests**

I have a considerable amount of knowledge in C++ and am quite comfortable working in C++ as C++ has been the daily driver for all my needs ( From last 2 years I have been working more on System Programming Projects than in other fields ). Also along with C++ I have good proficiency in languages such as C#, Visual Basic,  RUST, Java.

**Reason for Contributing to Boost Libraries**
C++ is the best language that I have worked on till now and out of curiosity, I wanted to know how the libraries and new features were introduced in the C++ language. This is when I was introduced to boost libraries for C++. I learned that Boost wrote code that was exceptional in quality and performance and has become the gold class industry standard for libraries in the C++ language. Along with that I also got to know that most of the features in C++ came from the boost libraries that had been written several years ago (2001,2002,2003). From that onwards, I became a big fan of Boost and always wanted to contribute to boost and someday have my own libraries in the boost and C++ standard itself. Also, I saw the real power of Open Source from boost. I believe that making a project open source and freeware not only makes it free for the people but also improves the quality of the code drastically.  This the main reason why I want to contribute to "boost" libraries.
