## Availability : 

**How much time do you plan to spend on your GSOC?**

 I intend to spend about **36 Hours** per week *( 6 Hours every day * 6 Days )*  during the **3 Month Period**.  On weekends if required, I can spend more than 6 hours.  Mostly i work during the evening hours from  **6:00pm to 11:00pm** but during **holidays** i can work early in the morning also from **3:30 am to 6:00 am** .

**What are your intended start and end dates?**

I can start working on the project after **10th-15th May 2020** as after **15th May** my exams will be over and my 3 month  summer vacation will start by that time, so I will be able to fully concentrate on the project. Also I will require about 1 week's time ( During Community Bonding period or after ) to get to the drawing board with my mentor and design the higher level API from scratch in order to build API of high quality with ample amount of flexibility in it.  I intend to finish the project work on or before **August 10 2020**.

**What other factors affect your availability ?**

During the month of **July** I would request  **2 days** leave as i would have to go for an exhibition along with my team in Bangalore for **MC Afee Scholars Programme**. Other than that I am completely free during the summers and don't have any other commitments as such.
